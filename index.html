			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I was Born in Valparaíso, Chile. I graduated in Industrial Engineering and finished my MS in Economics (both at University of Chile) in 2013. I worked for several years as a Research Analyst doing economic and data analysis. In 2018 I moved to Barcelona, where I did my master’s degree in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. After that, I started my PhD on narrative coherence and disfluency as clinical markers of cognitive dysfunctions, under the supervision of professor Wolfram Hinzen. Currently, my research interest are narrative structures, and semantic and referential meaning in clinical population with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. My aim is to understand how different linguistic devices operate in these people, illuminating also the contrast with neurotypical people. To this end, I use NLP computational tools and usually program in Python and Stata. As for my personal interests, I like to learn new languages (currently studying Russian and Japanese). In my free time I also read and write poetry, take long walks and am always looking for new recipes.</p>
